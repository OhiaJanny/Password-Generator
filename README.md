# Module 5 Challenge: Password Generator

## Overview
 
This week’s challenge requires me to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

It should be able to:

* Generate a password when the button is clicked
  * Present a series of prompts for password criteria
    * Length of passwordg
      * At least 10 characters but no more than 64.
    * Character types
      * Lowercase
      * Uppercase
      * Numeric
      * Special characters ($@%&*, etc).
